Their sales on eBay really took off so from there they set up a social media account and soon after, a website.<\/p><p>The company grew at a fast pace but it wasn’t all smooth sailing. One of the first suppliers that Claire and Mike trusted stole £30,000 of their money, which at that time was all of their money! However, in their own words, “the key is not to quit, every successful person hasn’t quit.”<\/p><p>If you want to find out more, and listen to Claire and Mike answering your questions about Oh Polly, starting a business and general tips and tricks then head over to our Youtube video.<\/p>",

At Oh Polly, we like to be different and always with you in mind, as we love our customers!<br\/><br\/>Our buyers do not purchase wholesale products, which allows us to keep our designs super unique - and of course that little bit extra! All our products are designed in house by a small, incredibly talented design team. All our collections are curated by a small buying team led by our Creative Director.<br\/><br\/>We also pride ourselves on being incredibly involved with the people and production behind every Oh Polly 'fit. Our founders, Mike Branney and Claire Henderson, set up our two main factories when Oh Polly started. This means we have control over our workers' safety, the wages they are paid, and the quality of the product at every stage of manufacturing in those factories.<br\/><br\/><br\/><strong>WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS<\/strong><br\/>If you shop at Oh Polly and you know your stuff then it’s unlikely you need us to remind you of the harmful effects this industry has on our planet.
